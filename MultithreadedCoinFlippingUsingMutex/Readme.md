Tried implementing the basic concept of threads and mutex locks in C using coin flipping example. </br>
I have used three different strategies for the mutex lock and compared their times to see the effect. </br> </br>
In this way I concluded that the cost of obtaining locks frequently is much higher than the performance gain obtained by using multiple threads.
